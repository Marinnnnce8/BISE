		<p>Traditional whaling wasn’t commercial.  It was unpredictable, and happened wherever the whales came.  Hunts were exciting, and all the folk in the district stopped what they were doing to take part; in Orkney and Shetland it didn’t even matter if it was Sunday.  Everyone worked as a community, in boats or on the beach.</p>

		<p>People launched boats whilst others ran to the shore with every sharp farm tool available. The hunters rowed beyond the whales and formed into two lines, then herded the animals into the bay where they were beached.  Once the lead whale grounded, the killing began.</p>

		<p>The right to the catch was centuries-old, divided amongst participants, but in the Northern Isles landowners claimed a large share, without taking part in the hunt.</p>

		<p class="uk-text-lead">All the Atlantic islanders used to hunt whales. Only the Faroese still whale today. Why did the other islands stop?</p>

		<p>The culture of Britain’s islands changed in the 18th century, and some traditions declined. Islanders adopted a genteel notion against eating whales. By the 1750s just poorer Hebrideans ate them, and Shetlanders just did during famine. By 1800 whales weren’t eaten at all. People still caught them for oil, but the meat wasn’t even used for manure. By the 1890s, prosperity and imported oil meant the blubber wasn’t needed, and islanders abandoned hunting.</p>

		<p>Whaling isn’t necessary for survival today, but many things we do aren’t. There are two reasons it won’t return though. Firstly, our indigenous whaling stopped before legal protection could be given as it has elsewhere. More importantly, our culture is now more shaped by outside society, so views on whales are guided by environmentalism not traditions.</p>
