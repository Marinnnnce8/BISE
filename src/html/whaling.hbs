		<p>Traditional whaling wasn’t commercial.  It was unpredictable, and happened wherever the whales came.  Hunts were exciting, and all the folk in the district stopped what they were doing to take part; in Orkney and Shetland it didn’t even matter if it was Sunday.  Everyone worked as a community, in boats or on the beach.</p>

		<p>People launched boats whilst others ran to the shore with every sharp farm tool available. The hunters rowed beyond the whales and formed into two lines, then herded the animals into the bay where they were beached.  Once the lead whale grounded, the killing began.</p>

		<p>The right to the catch was centuries-old, divided amongst participants, but in the Northern Isles landowners claimed a large share, without taking part in the hunt.</p>
